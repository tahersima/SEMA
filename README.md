# SEMA (Scanning Electron Microscopy Autoencoder)

SEMA is a python and tensorflow based software to train an unsupervised learning model to compress SEM images to a latent space representation and reconstruct the image.

# Application of SEMA

* Remove bright spots caused by the electron charging effect
* Remove noise from an SEM image
* Give style to SEM images
